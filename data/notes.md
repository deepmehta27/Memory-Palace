# Biology Study Notes

**Photosynthesis**: The process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen.

**Mitochondria**: Known as the powerhouse of the cell, these organelles produce ATP through cellular respiration.

**DNA**: Deoxyribonucleic acid, the hereditary material that contains genetic instructions for all living organisms.

**Osmosis**: The movement of water molecules through a semipermeable membrane from an area of high concentration to low concentration.

**ATP**: Adenosine triphosphate, the main energy currency of the cell.

**Cell Membrane**: The flexible boundary that controls what enters and exits the cell.

**Chloroplast**: The organelle where photosynthesis occurs in plant cells.
