# Biology Study Notes

## Chapter 1: Cell Structure and Function

### The Cell Theory
All living organisms are composed of cells, which are the basic units of life. The cell theory states:
1. All living things are made of one or more cells
2. The cell is the basic unit of life
3. All cells come from pre-existing cells

### Types of Cells

#### Prokaryotic Cells
Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Examples include bacteria and archaea. Key features:
- DNA is located in the nucleoid region
- Ribosomes are present for protein synthesis
- Cell wall provides structure and protection
- Smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells

#### Eukaryotic Cells
Eukaryotic cells have a membrane-bound nucleus and various organelles. Found in plants, animals, fungi, and protists.

### Cell Organelles and Their Functions

**Nucleus**: The control center of the cell that contains DNA and regulates gene expression. The nuclear envelope has pores that control molecular traffic.

**Mitochondria**: Known as the powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria produce ATP through cellular respiration. They have their own DNA and can replicate independently.

**Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**:
- Rough ER: Studded with ribosomes, synthesizes proteins for export
- Smooth ER: Lacks ribosomes, synthesizes lipids and detoxifies substances

**Golgi Apparatus**: Modifies, packages, and ships proteins received from the ER. Often called the "post office" of the cell.

**Lysosomes**: Contain digestive enzymes that break down waste materials, cellular debris, and foreign substances. Known as the "cleanup crew" of the cell.

**Ribosomes**: Protein synthesis machines that translate mRNA into proteins. Can be free-floating or attached to the ER.

**Cell Membrane**: A phospholipid bilayer that controls what enters and exits the cell through selective permeability.

## Chapter 2: Photosynthesis

### Overview
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose.

### The Photosynthesis Equation
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

### Two Main Stages

#### Light-Dependent Reactions (Light Reactions)
- Occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts
- Capture light energy using chlorophyll
- Produce ATP and NADPH
- Release oxygen as a byproduct from water splitting

#### Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)
- Occur in the stroma of chloroplasts
- Use ATP and NADPH from light reactions
- Fix carbon dioxide into glucose
- Also called the dark reactions (though they occur during the day)

### Factors Affecting Photosynthesis
1. **Light intensity**: More light generally increases rate until saturation
2. **Carbon dioxide concentration**: Higher CO₂ levels increase rate to a point
3. **Temperature**: Optimal range exists; too hot denatures enzymes
4. **Water availability**: Essential reactant; drought stress reduces photosynthesis

## Chapter 3: DNA and Genetics

### DNA Structure
DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is a double helix structure composed of:
- **Nucleotides**: Each containing a sugar, phosphate group, and nitrogenous base
- **Base pairs**: Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C)
- **Antiparallel strands**: One strand runs 5' to 3', the other 3' to 5'

### DNA Replication
The process of copying DNA before cell division:
1. **Helicase** unwinds the double helix
2. **Primase** adds RNA primers
3. **DNA polymerase** adds complementary nucleotides
4. **Leading strand** synthesized continuously
5. **Lagging strand** synthesized in Okazaki fragments
6. **Ligase** joins the fragments together

### Gene Expression
**Transcription**: DNA → RNA
- RNA polymerase reads DNA template
- Creates complementary mRNA strand
- Occurs in the nucleus

**Translation**: RNA → Protein
- Ribosomes read mRNA codons
- tRNA brings corresponding amino acids
- Peptide bonds form between amino acids
- Occurs in the cytoplasm

### Mendelian Genetics

#### Key Terms
- **Gene**: A segment of DNA that codes for a trait
- **Allele**: Different versions of a gene
- **Dominant**: Allele that masks the recessive allele
- **Recessive**: Allele expressed only when homozygous
- **Homozygous**: Two identical alleles (AA or aa)
- **Heterozygous**: Two different alleles (Aa)
- **Genotype**: Genetic makeup of an organism
- **Phenotype**: Physical expression of genes

#### Punnett Squares
Used to predict offspring genotypes and phenotypes from parent crosses.

Example: Monohybrid cross (Aa × Aa)
- 25% AA (homozygous dominant)
- 50% Aa (heterozygous)
- 25% aa (homozygous recessive)
- Phenotypic ratio: 3:1 (dominant:recessive)

## Chapter 4: Cellular Respiration

### Overview
Cellular respiration breaks down glucose to produce ATP, the energy currency of cells.

### Equation
C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ATP (energy)

### Three Main Stages

#### 1. Glycolysis
- Occurs in the cytoplasm
- Breaks glucose into two pyruvate molecules
- Produces 2 ATP (net) and 2 NADH
- Anaerobic process (doesn't require oxygen)

#### 2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)
- Occurs in mitochondrial matrix
- Pyruvate converted to acetyl-CoA
- Produces 2 ATP, 6 NADH, 2 FADH₂
- Releases CO₂ as waste

#### 3. Electron Transport Chain
- Occurs on inner mitochondrial membrane
- NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons
- Creates proton gradient for ATP synthesis
- Produces ~32-34 ATP
- Oxygen is final electron acceptor

### Fermentation (Anaerobic Respiration)
When oxygen is absent:
- **Lactic acid fermentation**: Occurs in muscle cells, produces lactate
- **Alcoholic fermentation**: Occurs in yeast, produces ethanol and CO₂

## Chapter 5: Evolution and Natural Selection

### Darwin's Theory of Evolution
Charles Darwin proposed that species evolve through natural selection:

#### Key Principles
1. **Variation**: Individuals in a population vary in traits
2. **Inheritance**: Traits are passed from parents to offspring
3. **Selection**: Some traits provide survival advantages
4. **Time**: Evolution occurs over many generations

### Evidence for Evolution
- **Fossil record**: Shows progression of life forms over time
- **Comparative anatomy**: Homologous structures suggest common ancestry
- **Molecular biology**: DNA and protein similarities between species
- **Biogeography**: Distribution of species reflects evolutionary history
- **Direct observation**: Bacterial resistance, peppered moths

### Types of Selection
- **Natural selection**: Environmental pressures favor certain traits
- **Artificial selection**: Humans select for desired traits (breeding)
- **Sexual selection**: Traits that improve mating success are favored

### Speciation
Formation of new species through:
- **Geographic isolation**: Physical barriers separate populations
- **Reproductive isolation**: Groups can no longer interbreed
- **Genetic drift**: Random changes in small populations
- **Gene flow**: Movement of genes between populations

## Chapter 6: Ecology and Ecosystems

### Levels of Organization
1. **Organism**: Individual living thing
2. **Population**: Group of same species in an area
3. **Community**: All populations in an area
4. **Ecosystem**: Community plus abiotic factors
5. **Biome**: Large regional ecosystem
6. **Biosphere**: All life on Earth

### Energy Flow
- **Producers**: Make their own food (plants, algae)
- **Primary consumers**: Herbivores that eat producers
- **Secondary consumers**: Carnivores that eat herbivores
- **Tertiary consumers**: Top predators
- **Decomposers**: Break down dead matter

### Food Chains and Webs
- Energy flows in one direction
- Only ~10% of energy transfers between trophic levels
- Food webs show complex feeding relationships

### Nutrient Cycles

#### Carbon Cycle
- Photosynthesis removes CO₂ from atmosphere
- Respiration returns CO₂ to atmosphere
- Decomposition releases stored carbon
- Fossil fuel combustion adds CO₂

#### Nitrogen Cycle
- Nitrogen fixation converts N₂ to ammonia
- Nitrification converts ammonia to nitrates
- Plants absorb nitrates
- Denitrification returns N₂ to atmosphere

#### Water Cycle
- Evaporation from surfaces
- Transpiration from plants
- Condensation forms clouds
- Precipitation returns water to Earth

### Symbiotic Relationships
- **Mutualism**: Both species benefit (bees and flowers)
- **Commensalism**: One benefits, other unaffected (barnacles on whales)
- **Parasitism**: One benefits, other harmed (tapeworms in intestines)
