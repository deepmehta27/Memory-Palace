Steps in a Machine Learning Pipeline

1. Data Collection:
Gather raw data from databases, APIs, sensors, or files. Example: transaction data from an e-commerce platform.

2. Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries. This ensures the dataset is accurate and reliable.

3. Data Preprocessing:
Transform raw data into suitable formats. Includes normalization, scaling, encoding categorical variables, and text preprocessing.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize data distributions, correlations, and anomalies. Tools like matplotlib or seaborn help uncover insights.

5. Feature Engineering:
Create or modify features to improve model performance. For example, extracting “day of week” from a timestamp.

6. Model Selection:
Choose an algorithm suited for the task (e.g., Random Forest for classification, Linear Regression for prediction).

7. Model Training:
Fit the model on the training set, adjusting weights or rules to minimize error.

8. Model Evaluation:
Use test data and metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE) to measure performance.

9. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimize settings using techniques like Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization.

10. Deployment:
Integrate the trained model into production environments where it can make predictions on new data.

11. Monitoring and Maintenance:
Track model drift, retrain when needed, and ensure the system remains reliable and accurate.
