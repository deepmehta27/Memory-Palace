# Common Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning algorithms are the building blocks of intelligent systems. Each algorithm has unique strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.

## Regression
- **Linear Regression**: Fits a straight line to predict continuous outcomes. Useful for price prediction or forecasting.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Extends linear regression to model curved relationships.

## Classification
- **Logistic Regression**: Despite its name, it is used for classification problems (e.g., spam detection).
- **Decision Trees**: Rule-based models that split data into branches, easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and reduces variance.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Powerful classifiers that find the optimal boundary (hyperplane) between classes.

## Neural Networks
Inspired by the human brain, neural networks consist of interconnected layers of nodes. They excel in image recognition, natural language processing, and generative AI.

## Clustering
- **K-Means**: Groups data into K clusters based on similarity.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds nested clusters represented as a tree (dendrogram).

## Dimensionality Reduction
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces data to fewer dimensions while preserving variance.
- **t-SNE/UMAP**: Techniques for visualizing high-dimensional data.

These algorithms are often combined in pipelines to tackle real-world tasks. Choosing the right algorithm depends on the problem type, data quality, and computational resources.
