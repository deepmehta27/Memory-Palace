# Machine Learning Basics

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. At its core, ML involves feeding data into algorithms that adapt and improve performance over time.

## Core Paradigms
**Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled datasets, where input-output pairs are provided. Common examples include predicting house prices, spam detection, and image classification.

**Unsupervised Learning**: Here, the model identifies hidden patterns or structures in unlabeled data. Techniques include clustering (e.g., customer segmentation) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: RL focuses on agents that take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Applications include robotics, recommendation systems, and game-playing AI like AlphaGo.

## Key Concepts
- **Features**: The measurable properties or inputs.
- **Labels**: The outputs we want to predict.
- **Training vs. Testing Data**: Training data teaches the model, while testing data evaluates its performance.
- **Overfitting**: When a model memorizes the training data but fails to generalize.
- **Underfitting**: When a model is too simplistic and cannot capture important patterns.

Machine learning has revolutionized industries like healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles by automating complex decision-making processes. Understanding the basics provides a strong foundation for exploring advanced algorithms and practical applications.
