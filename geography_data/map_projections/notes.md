# Map Projections

**Mercator Projection**: Cylindrical map preserving direction but distorting area near poles.
**Robinson Projection**: Compromise projection balancing shape and area distortions.
**Equal-Area Projection**: Preserves area at the expense of shape distortion.
**Great Circle**: Shortest path between two points on a sphere.
**Scale**: Ratio between map distance and ground distance.
