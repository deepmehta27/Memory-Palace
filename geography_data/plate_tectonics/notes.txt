**Lithosphere**: The rigid outer shell of the Earth, broken into tectonic plates.
**Asthenosphere**: Semi-fluid mantle layer on which plates move.
**Convergent Boundary**: Plates move toward each other; can form mountains or subduction zones.
**Divergent Boundary**: Plates move apart; new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges.
**Transform Boundary**: Plates slide horizontally past each other along faults.
